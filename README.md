      I am an incoming Business Analytics graduate student at Michigan State University with international background and a combination of skills ranging from problem-solving, 
      analytics, and communication developed from a variety of work experience in the Supply Chain area.

      engine components in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) zone.
